# ShittyMicrowave
A shitty microwave that can't cook anything at all

Ever wanted to cook *nothing* in the shittiest microwave of them all? Well you're in luck because now you can!

1) Open the solution file in visual studio.
2) Hit F5, bwoi!
3) Smell the sweet, sweet aroma of disappointment as nothing is served whatsoever, and optionally contemplate exactly why you bothered to download this program at all.
4) ...Enjoy!
